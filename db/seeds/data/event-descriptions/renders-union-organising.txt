ACORN Brighton are hosting a training day to train new organisers to build our renters' union. 

Brighton's housing is in crisis. The average rent for a one bedroom flat is over £900 per month and over £600 per month for even a single room in a shared house. 37 per cent of these homes are in sub-standard condition. Thousands of us are in temporary accommodation and the amount of us sleeping rough on our streets continues to grow. With rent prices increasing by between 10 and 20 per cent a year many of us are just one pay-check away from homelessness.

This training workshop will give local community organisers the training and tools needed to build a renters' union in our city. We will learn how to build our union through outreach and recruitment, effective communications, and how to use people-power to fight back against exploitative landlords and have more say in how we run our communities. Most importantly, we will learn how to win!

This event is open to everyone whether you are an experienced campaigner or a complete newbie. All that matters is that you want to make positive changes in our community and change the rigged system.
