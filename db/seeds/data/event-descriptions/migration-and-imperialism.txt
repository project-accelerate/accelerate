On the day we will screen two films. The first is entitled Violent Borders and looks at the violence of borders and the racism and inhumanity of mass deportation charter flights. And the second is entitled Working Illegally and explores looks behind politicians' rhetoric, the closed walls and barbed wire of UK border enforcement, to expose the reality of immigration detention, raising pressing questions concerning its nature and purpose.

After each film is screened, we will open up the floor to the audience in order to further explore the themes covered and discuss the current state of affairs in regards to migration and imperialism.

The day will end with a workshop run in collaboration between activists and STRIKE! Magazine that will look provide a space to explore how violent borders are affecting communities in the UK and around the world. As we explore the current context of the UK immigration system and deportations, there will be interactive participatory discussion with explorations for how you can get involved in the campaign.

Finally, some of the money raised by the sale of tickets will be donated to SOAS Detainee Support (SDS), a student-led initiative working in solidarity with migrants in and outside detention centres, aiming to reduce isolation through visits, to empower detainees and campaign to put an end to the use of immigration detention.
