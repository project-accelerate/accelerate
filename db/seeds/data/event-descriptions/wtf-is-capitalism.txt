The Brighton and Hove Political Economy Reading group would like to invite you to our next event - 'WTF is Capitalism?'

In this event we aim to build our knowledge from the beginning and attemtp to understand the political and economic system that we live in - capitalism. The discussion will be based upon selected readings from critical and cultural theoriest Mark Fisher and anthropology proefessor David Harvey (as well as an additional optional reading from the original absolute boy - Karl Marx)

From these readings we will be able to discuss different understandings of what capitalism is and discuss some traditional and contemporary critiques. 

This event start a new direction for the Brighton and Hove Political Economy Reading Group as we go back to basics and build our knowledge and critique from the bottom-up. The group aims to be as inclusive as possible and welcomes new faces fom a variety of backgrounds and levels of knowledge so we can all learn together. Over the upcoming month we will be dicussing themese such as liberalism & neoliberalism, capitalism & feminism, socialism and the Labour movement, and postcapitalism and other alternatives. 

Please feel free to post any useful links or ask any questions.

We look forward to seeing you on the 8th November!
