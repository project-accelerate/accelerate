On 7 February, the IWGB sent a couple of demands to Deliveroo to fight for the rights of their riders. Two weeks later, Deliveroo accepted the recruitment freeze - but drivers still wait for for tiny increase of Â£1 per drop.

The IWGB will need support from every corner of Brighton for it to succeed! So come down for more information on the campaign or to show your support!

We've already won one of our two key demands, let's knock another down!
