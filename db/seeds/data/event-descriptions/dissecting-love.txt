Consented brings you Dissecting Love, a day of discussions exploring the relationship between love and the power structures that shape our existence.

Love is often presented as something natural and instinctual – outside of the control of broader power structures. It’s often said for that “you can’t help who you fall in love with”. But can you? And why is there so much emphasis on romantic love, rather than platonic love or familial love. Why are some bodies better positioned to receive love and to love themselves than others?

These questions are pertinent when we live in a time of gross individualist capitalism which renders people lonely and depressed.

Why is it that some forms of love are deemed more acceptable than others? And what if the mainstream, hegemonic Hollywood depiction of love isn’t for of all us? What are we left with?

The four workshops we will delve into the following: queer love; the relationship between capitalism, individualism and love; polyamory and finally self love.

As always, guests will have to choose to attend two of the four workshops, however, there will be an extended Q&A at the end of the day so everyone will get a chance to hear from those running all the workshops.
